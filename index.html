        <p>
            If you're planning on presenting there are a few things to keep in mind:

            <ul>
                <li>The assignments of talks is, barring any exceptional circumstances, random so make sure you register with the <a href="#contact">coordinator</a> as soon as you can</li>
                <li>Each talk is usually either an overview of a paper or a summary of the presenter's own work and is almost always accompanied by slides</li>
                <li>An abstract of your talk needs to be written up at least one week prior and sent to the <a href="#contact">coordinator</a></li>
                <li>Each talk should start punctually at 4:15 and be 20 minutes long with 10 minutes afterwards for questions</li>
                <li>Cookies and tea will be provided by the group, so you don't have to worry about bringing anything</li>
                <li>It's your responsibility to make sure that you pass over any disruptive questions if they divert from the talk</li>
                <li>It's highly recommended, though not essential, that you release your slides after the talk</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
