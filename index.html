        <h1>The Tea Time Talks</h1>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">
        The Tea Time Talks are a series of talks primarily given by the faculty and students studying Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Alberta.  Everyone is welcome to attend!
        <br><br>The 2024 talks will commence on June 18th and continue through the end of August. These sessions are scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 4:15 PM to 4:45 PM MT, in room 3-33 of the Computing Science Centre (CSC) at the University of Alberta. If you are unable to attend in person, you may access the talks using <a href="#zoom">Zoom</a>. If joining via Zoom, please be aware that the talks may be recorded and later uploaded to the Amii Intelligence YouTube channel. Before joining a talk, ensure that you have checked your Zoom privacy settings.
        <br><br><b>Code of Conduct</b>
        <br>The purpose of these talks is to give junior researchers an opportunity to present their on-going work. The attitude should be the one of collaboration when asking questions. Questions during the talk should primarily be about minor clarifications. Broader discussions about the overall line of research and larger confusions are best reserved for the Q&A session. Doing so ensures that we allow the speaker to execute their planned talk with-in the allotted 20 minutes. Any feedback about style or structure of the talk can be shared privately afterwards.
        <br><br><b>Give a Talk</b>
        <br>If you would like to give a talk, then you can sign up <a href="https://calendly.com/sfaiz-ualberta/2024-tea-time-talks" target="_blank">here</a> but make sure to first read the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines for presenters</a>!

  <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines for Presenters</h2>
  <font size="+1" face = "sans serif">
    <p>
      If you're planning on presenting, there are a few things to keep in mind:

      <ul>
        <li>Each talk is usually either an overview of a paper or a summary of your own work, and is almost always accompanied by slides.</li>
        <li>A talk slot can be registered 2 days before the talk.</li>
        <li>A scheduled talk can be cancelled with 7 days notice.</li>
        <li>An abstract of your talk needs to be written and sent to the <a href="#contact">coordinator</a> a minimum of 2 days prior to your talk.</li>
        <li>It is your responsibility to limit your talk to 20 minutes, starting punctually at 4:15 pm and ending punctually at 4:35 pm.  Make sure that you pass over disruptive questions, if they divert from your talk.</li>
        <li>After each talk, 10 minutes are allocated for questions from the audience.  You should end the question period punctually at 4:45 pm.</li>
        <li>It's highly recommended, though not required, to release your slides after the talk.</li>
      </ul>
