      </div>

      <p class="lead">
        The Tea Time Talks are a series of talks primarily given by the faculty and students studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of Alberta.  Everyone is welcome to attend!
        <br><br>The 2022 talks will start June 13th and will run until late August.  Talks are scheduled to be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 4:15 pm - 4:45 pm MT.
        <br><br>The 2022 talks will have a hybrid format.  There will be mix of in-person talks and online talks (via <a href="#zoom">Zoom</a>).
        <br><br>If you would like to give a talk, then you can sign up <a href="https://calendly.com/sschoepp/2022-tea-time-talks?month=2022-06">here</a> but make sure to first read the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines for presenters</a>!
        <!-- <br><br><b>Talks may be recorded and subsequently posted to the Amii Intelligence YouTube channel.  Please check your Zoom privacy settings prior to joining a talk.</b> -->
        <br><br>Code of Conduct: The purpose of these talks is to give junior researchers an opportunity to present their on-going work. The attitude should be the one of collaboration when asking questions. Questions during the talk should primarily be about minor clarifications. Broader discussions about the overall line of research and larger confusions are best reserved for the Q&A session. Doing so ensures that we allow the speaker to execute their planned talk with-in the allotted 20 minutes. Any feedback about style or structure of the talk can be shared privately afterwards.

  <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines for Presenters</h2>
  <font size="+1" face = "sans serif">
    <p>
      If you're planning on presenting, there are a few things to keep in mind:

      <ul>
        <li>Each talk is usually either an overview of a paper or a summary of your own work, and is almost always accompanied by slides.</li>
        <li>An abstract of your talk needs to be written and sent to the <a href="#contact">coordinator</a> a minimum of 24 hours prior to your talk.</li>
        <li>It is your responsiblity to limit your talk to 20 minutes, starting punctually at 4:15 pm and ending punctually at 4:35 pm.  Make sure that you pass over disruptive questions, if they divert from your talk.</li>
        <li>After each talk, 10 minutes are allocated for questions from the audience.  You should end the question period puctually at 4:45 pm.</li>
        <li>It's highly recommended, though not required, to release your slides after the talk.</li>
      </ul>
