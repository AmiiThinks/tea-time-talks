  <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines for Presenters</h2>
  <font size="+1" face = "sans serif">
    <p>
      If you're planning on presenting, there are a few things to keep in mind:

      <ul>
        <li>Each talk is usually either an overview of a paper or a summary of the presenter's own work and is almost always accompanied by slides.</li>
        <li>An abstract of your talk needs to be written up at least 24 hours prior and sent to the <a href="mailto:sschoepp@ualberta.ca">coordinator</a>.</li>
        <li>Each talk should start punctually at 4:15 pm and should end punctually at 4:45 pm.</li>
        <li>Each talk should be 20 minutes long, with 10 minutes afterwards for questions.</li>
        <li>It's your responsibility to make sure that you pass over any disruptive questions if they divert from the talk.</li>
        <li>It's highly recommended, though not essential, that you release your slides after the talk.</li>
      </ul>
